# sway-dots

Reference dotfiles for a Sway/SwayFX desktop setup. These are not deployed directly — they serve as a reference when configuring `~/.config/`.

## Structure
Each directory/file corresponds to a tool's config: `sway/`, `waybar/`, `kitty/`, `wofi/`, `mako/`, `nvim/`, `zathura/`, `starship.toml`, etc.

## Active config location
The live configs are in `~/.config/` — edit those, not this repo.
